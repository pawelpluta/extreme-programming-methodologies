# Supreme Programming Methodologies

One day, some developers started to write names of new programming methodologies that they identified. By strong 
suggestion of another team member - T.G. - we decided to bring them to broader audience, so also other, struggling teams 
can benefit from them. We care about developers, as we also are them, so we decided to describe those fascinating methodologies.

> Writing means sharing. It's part of the human condition to want to share things - thoughts, ideas, opinions.
