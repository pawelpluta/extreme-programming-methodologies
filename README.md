# Supreme Programming Methodologies

One day, some developers started to write names of new programming methodologies that they identified. By strong 
suggestion of another team member - T.G. - we decided to bring them to broader audience, so also other, struggling teams 
can benefit from them. We care about developers, as we also are them, so we decided to describe those fascinating methodologies.

We believe that you already might use them but do not know proper approach. Review you knowlegde, and bring those methodologies to live.
